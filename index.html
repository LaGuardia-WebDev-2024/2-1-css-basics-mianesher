    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
    <p>The <em>cat</em> is awesome because <strong>they're literally the cutest animal ever. They basically just eat and sleep all day, and love attention, cuddles, and being pet. Whoever does't like cats is lying or is allergic to happiness. My cat is my favorite living thing. All the cat breeds are cute but I really like persian cats because of how fluffy they are. I also think calico cats are awesome. Just in general, cats are so sick, and by far the best pet. </strong>.</p>
